The study of fluid dynamics in the airways of the human lung has been a significant and captivating area of research since the 1960s, with the creation of the most basic human lung
model by Weibel . Understanding and potentially controlling the causes of diseases such as Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) etc. has become crucial due to the
increased risks of lung and nasal cancer resulting from the inhalation of harmful particles. Consequently, knowledge of these flow fields has become critical. A comprehensive
understanding of these flow fields is also crucial for accurate drug targeting, particulate inhalation, and the injection of medicinal products to the human body via inhalation. This
method can been widely accepted as a convenient, replicable, and harmless means of delivering drugs to both lung tissue and the systemic circulation. Hence the secondary flow Particle
deposition characteristics have been simulated using a control volume method to solve the three dimensional laminar Navier Stokes equation for an inspiratory flow. A lower three
generation human lung airway extracted from fifth to seventh branches of Weibelâ€™s model is taken as the elementary computational domain. The computations are carried out to
understand and compare physics of secondary flow, Particle deposition in healthy, and Asthma/(COPD) affected human lung airway.
